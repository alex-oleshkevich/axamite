The component library for Tailwind CSS 4.

## Why?

I need a good looking component library which I can use in any context (pure HTML/CSS, React, Vue, you name it).
The most libraries out there are specific to a framework or their UX/DX does not match my expectactions.

So I created that library.

## Vision

This library is built upon these concepts:

- **use modern CSS**: no ugly cssinjs or any other brain fuck
- **use web components**: use Custom Elements for complex components. They are can be used with good old HTML as well as with Vue/React.
- **use CSS custom properties**: use these props to configure component
- **be semantic**: try to use semantic names as much as possible
- **CSS classes**: incapsulate components in CSS classes
